Hi [Name],

Your recent TechCrunch article about scaling to 100 employees caught my attention. The challenge you mentioned about qualifying enterprise leads resonated with me.

At LeadIQ, we helped Datadog reduce time-to-qualified-lead by 40% in Q1. I'd love to share how we did it - might be relevant as you scale.

Your blog post on "B2B Content That Converts" was spot-on. The section about buyer psychology especially.

We're a content agency that's helped 3 SaaS companies in your space (Salesforce, HubSpot, Intercom) 3x their organic traffic in 6 months.

Would a 20-min intro call make sense? I can show you exactly what we did.
