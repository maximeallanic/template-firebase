# Spicy vs Sweet - AI-Powered Cold Email Analysis Tool

## Overview

Spicy vs Sweet is a professional web-based SaaS platform designed to help sales professionals, marketers, business developers, recruiters, and entrepreneurs improve their cold email campaigns through AI-powered analysis and feedback.

## What Spicy vs Sweet Does

Spicy vs Sweet analyzes cold emails in real-time using Google's advanced **Gemini 2.5 Flash AI** model via Vertex AI. The platform evaluates emails across **7 critical dimensions** and provides:

- **Detailed scoring** (0-10) for each criterion
- **Actionable improvement suggestions** prioritized by impact
- **Sentence-level rewrites** showing before/after examples
- **Instant feedback** delivered in seconds

## The 7 Analysis Criteria

### 1. Subject Line Effectiveness
Evaluates subject line length, curiosity factor, clarity, and spam trigger words. Optimal subject lines are 30-50 characters, create intrigue without being clickbait, and avoid spam filters.

### 2. Personalization Quality
Assesses depth of research, relevance to recipient, and use of specific details. Strong personalization references recent company news, specific pain points, or individual achievements.

### 3. Value Proposition Clarity
Measures how clearly and compellingly the email communicates what's in it for the recipient. Effective value propositions are specific, quantifiable, and relevant.

### 4. Call-to-Action (CTA) Strength
Evaluates CTA clarity, specificity, and ease of action. Strong CTAs make the next step obvious and low-friction (e.g., "Reply with your availability for a 15-minute call").

### 5. Length Optimization
Analyzes whether the email is concise enough to maintain attention while being comprehensive enough to convey value. Ideal length: 50-125 words.

### 6. Tone and Language
Assesses professionalism level, formality appropriateness, and language clarity. Tone should match the industry and relationship stage (cold outreach vs. warm follow-up).

### 7. Overall Professionalism
Evaluates grammar, spelling, formatting, and presentation quality. Professional emails are error-free, well-structured, and visually scannable.
